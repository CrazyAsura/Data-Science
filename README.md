# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my collection of Data Science projects! In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects that I’ve worked on using **Python** and **R**. The projects explore different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, providing hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for most of the projects. Key libraries include:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow
- **R**: Used in a few specific projects to leverage its statistical and visualization capabilities.
- **SQL**: Used for database management and querying relational datasets.
